The contributions of Lagrange are numerous. He spent a lifetime making mathematical discoveries that have influenced several areas of science and mathematics. He made significant and profound discoveries in number theory, physics, calculus of variations, differential equations, mechanics, abstract algebra, and group theory. His book on analytic mechanics described a new framework for understanding physics called the Lagrangian function. Lagrange developed Lagrangian mechanics, a framework for classical mechanics that's based on the principle of least action. This transformed mechanics into a form of analysis that made it possible to solve complex physics problems. Lagrange also extended calculus variations to include constraints by developing Lagrange multipliers, which are used everywhere, including in applications related to machine learning. 	Lagrange was able to prove that every positive integer can be expressed as the sum of four integer squares. This is considered a major theorem that is widely used in number theory. Lagrange was also able to make a significant discovery in an astronomy problem called the Three-Body Problem. He discovered that there are special points of equilibrium between the Earth, Moon, and Sun that we now call Lagrange Points. These five Lagrange points are used now to keep satellites and other man-made objects orbiting the Earth for extended periods of time. These points are crucial for space missions, as they allow spacecraft to maintain stable positions with minimal fuel consumption. Understanding the dynamics of these points has opened up new possibilities for exploration and observation in space. 	One key achievement was Lagrange making an effort to give an exact definition of the derivative in calculus. Lagrange did this by eliminating reference to infinitesimals, fluxions, zeroes, and even limits. Lagrange thought that these references lacked proper definition (Katz 662). Lagrange then published his ideas in a paper he wrote in 1772 and then in 1797 wrote an entire textbook called The Theory of Analytic Function with his definitions of the derivative. The Lagrange book also contained the principles of differential calculus, which were considered in every proof. Lagrange then was able to reduce his calculus definitions to algebraic analysis of finite quantities (Katz 662). Lagrange was able to accomplish this by using the idea that any function can be represented as a power series. These results became part of what is now called the 'fundamental theorem of calculus.' Most mathematicians accepted his proof that any function can be expanded into a power series. However, they objected to the way he wrote his math notations. (Katz 665) Lagrange also attempted to find a solution for a general polynomial of degree n. But he was largely unsuccessful in this effort. However, his attempts did lay the groundwork for other mathematicians to work on similar algebraic equations during the 19th century (Katz 665). This period saw significant advancements, as mathematicians like Galois and Abel further developed the theories surrounding polynomial equations, ultimately leading to a deeper understanding of their solvability. Their contributions not only expanded the realm of algebra but also influenced future mathematical research and education.
